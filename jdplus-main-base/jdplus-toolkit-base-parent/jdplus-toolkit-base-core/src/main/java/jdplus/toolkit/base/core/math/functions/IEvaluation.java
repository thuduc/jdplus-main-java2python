/**
 * Interface implements by classes that can provide an evaluation of their
 * objects under the form of a real value.
 * The goal of this interface is to provide, in collaboration 
 * with the IParametric interface flexible implementations 
 * of IRealFunction. More specifically, suppose that we have a class A that 
 * implements IParametric and a class B that implements IEvaluation and 
 * such that its objects contain references to objects of the class A.
 * Then, a real function can trivially be constructed (see the class 
 * "FunctionInstance" for the code). Using that approach, the code for the 
 * evaluation is separated from the code of the parameterization and we can 
 * provide several "evaluation" functions for the same parametric object.
