/**
 * The false position algorithm is a method of finding roots based on linear
 * interpolation. Its convergence is linear, but it is usually faster than
 * bisection.
 *
 * On each iteration a line is drawn between the endpoints (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b))
 * and the point where this line crosses the x-axis taken as a “midpoint”. The
 * value of the function at this point is calculated and its sign is used to
 * determine which side of the interval does not contain a root. That side is
 * discarded to give a new, smaller interval containing the root. This procedure
 * can be continued indefinitely until the interval is sufficiently small.
 *
 * The best estimate of the root is taken from the linear interpolation of the
 * interval on the current iteration.
