/**
 * The bisection algorithm is the simplest method of bracketing the roots of a
 * function.
 * It is the slowest algorithm provided by the library, with linear
 * convergence.
 * On each iteration, the interval is bisected and the value of the function at
 * the midpoint is calculated. The sign of this value is used to determine which
 * half of the interval does not contain a root. That half is discarded to give
 * a new, smaller interval containing the root. This procedure can be continued
 * indefinitely until the interval is sufficiently small.
 * At any time the current estimate of the root is taken as the midpoint of the
 * interval.
