/**
 * The Brent-Dekker method (referred to here as Brent’s method) combines an
 * interpolation strategy with the bisection algorithm. This produces a fast
 * algorithm which is still robust.
 *
 * On each iteration Brent’s method approximates the function using an
 * interpolating curve. On the first iteration this is a linear interpolation of
 * the two endpoints. For subsequent iterations the algorithm uses an inverse
 * quadratic fit to the last three points, for higher accuracy. The intercept of
 * the interpolating curve with the x-axis is taken as a guess for the root. If
 * it lies within the bounds of the current interval then the interpolating
 * point is accepted, and used to generate a smaller interval. If the
 * interpolating point is not accepted then the algorithm falls back to an
 * ordinary bisection step.
 *
 * The best estimate of the root is taken from the most recent interpolation or
 * bisection.
