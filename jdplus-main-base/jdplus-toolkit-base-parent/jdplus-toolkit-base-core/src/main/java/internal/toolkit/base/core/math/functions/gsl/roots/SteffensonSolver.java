/**
 * This is Newton's method with an Aitken "delta-squared"
 * acceleration of the iterates. This can improve the convergence on
 * multiple roots where the ordinary Newton algorithm is slow.
 *
 * x[i+1] = x[i] - f(x[i]) / f'(x[i])
 *
 * x_accelerated[i] = x[i] - (x[i+1] - x[i])**2 / (x[i+2] - 2*x[i+1] + x[i])
 *
 * We can only use the accelerated estimate after three iterations,
 * and use the unaccelerated value until then.
